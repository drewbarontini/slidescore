Slidescore
==========

Recently, I've seen a [few](http://wolfslittlestore.be/html-prototyping-talk/)
[sites](http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm) that posted slides from a talk alongside
a transcript next to each slide. I thought this was a really nice idea, so I
took it and built a little Middleman application that makes it easy.

First, configure the app in `data/config.yml`:

```yml
title: 'Talk Title'
description: 'This is the description of the talk.'
file_ext: 'png' # Standard image file extension (can change per slide)
table_of_contents: false
```

Next, you can start adding your slides in `data/slides.yml`:

```yml
- title: First Slide
  description: >
    This is some text for the first slide. It doesn't include an image, so it
    just uses a placeholder specified in `data/slides.yml`.
  image: 'http://placehold.it/1280x720/000/000'

- title: Second Slide
  description: >
    This is some text for the first slide. It doesn't include an image, so it
    just uses a placeholder specified in `data/slides.yml`.
  image: 'http://placehold.it/1280x720/000/000'

- title: Third Slide
  description: >
    This is some text for the first slide. It doesn't include an image, so it
    just uses a placeholder specified in `data/slides.yml`.
  image: 'http://placehold.it/1280x720/000/000'

- description: >
    This is some text for the fourth slide that doesn't have a title. Also,
    this slide changes the default `file_ext`, and it uses a standard image
    that is in `images/slides/04.gif`.
  file_ext: 'gif'

- title: Partial Slide
  partial: true
  file_ext: 'jpg'
```

You can specify the following:

- `title` &mdash; The title of the slide (optional)
- `description` &mdash; The description text (can use Markdown here!)
- `partial` &mdash; Set this to `true` if you want to move your Markdown description into a partial file (add your file to `source/slides/_SLIDENUMBER.md` - e.g. `source/slides/_05.md`)
- `image` &mdash; If you need to specify a custom location, otherwise it'll pull from `assets/images/slides/SLIDENUMBER.png` (e.g. `01.png` for the first slide, etc.)
- `file_ext` &mdash; If you need to change this slide's image extension from the one specified in `data/config.yml`

That's it! Now you can start building out the transcript alongside your slide images. Follow the steps below to get the Middleman app set up.

Setup
-----

```shell
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Running the Application
-----------------------

You run the application by starting the Middleman server:

```shell
middleman s
```

If you're using Rbenv with binstubs:

```shell
./bin/middleman s
```

Building the Static Files
-------------------------

To build the static files:

```shell
middleman build
```

Or, if you're using Rbenv:

```shell
./bin/middleman build
```

Deploying
---------

If you'd like to deploy the site, add a `Rakefile` and take a look at the [Baseman](https://github.com/drewbarontini/baseman#deploying) deploy documentation.

**Note**: Be sure to remove the `Rakefile` from the `.gitignore`!
