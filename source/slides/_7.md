You can also add your additional images as local files by:

1. Setting `additional_images: true`.
2. Setting `additional_images_number` to the number of additional images.
3. Naming the additional image files using the convention `SLIDENUMBER-IMAGENUMBER.png`
   (e.g. `7-1.png` for the seventh slide's first additional image).
